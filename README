Hash

A fast, performance focused, 32-bit non cryptographic hash

- object property order is preserved, `{ a: 1, b: 2 }` and `{ b: 2, a: 1 }` may hash to different values.

- some classes (e.g. ArrayBuffer) are not supported and will hash to 5381, for something more versatile check out hash-it (https://github.com/planttheidea/hash-it).

- function hashes may not be consistent across different environments.
