Hash

a fast, performance focused, 32-bit non cryptographic hash


- `""`, `[]`, `{}`, `undefined` hash to 5381.

- numbers hash the same as their string representation.

- object property order is preserved, `{ a: 1, b: 2 }` and `{ b: 2, a: 1 }` may hash to different values.

- some classes (e.g. ArrayBuffer) are not supported and will hash to 5381, for something more versatile check out hash-it (https://github.com/planttheidea/hash-it).

- function hashes may not be consistent across different environments.
