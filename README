Hash

A fast, performance focused, 32-bit non cryptographic hash

There are some limitations, frist of all, some classes (e.g. ArrayBuffer) are not supported and will all hash to the same value, for something more versatile check out hash-it (https://github.com/planttheidea/hash-it). Also, hashes may not be consistent across different environments, especially function ones. Notably, object property order is preserved, `{ a: 1, b: 2 }` and `{ b: 2, a: 1 }` may hash to different values.
